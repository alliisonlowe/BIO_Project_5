# BIO_Project_5
1. In your own words, discuss what biodiversity is and why it is important. Explain how biodiversity influences ecosystems.

2. Select ONE of the following major threats to biodiversity:

        Habitat loss
        Invasive species
        Pollution
        Overharvesting
        Climate change

3. Why is your chosen threat a serious problem? 

4. How has exponential human population growth contributed to your chosen threat?

5. How are non-human organisms directly affected by your chosen threat? 

6. How are humans impacted, either directly or indirectly, by your chosen threat?

7. What is currently being done to solve the problems caused by your chosen threat to biodiversity? Are there regulations or laws in place? If so, name and describe one.

8. What can people do in their daily lives to help combat your chosen threat to biodiversity? 

9. What innovative solutions either currently exist and should be implemented more, or are on the horizon? How do these solutions work? (This answer should not be the same as number 7 or 8) Please note: innovative means creative or advanced. Riding a bicycle and recycling, while great, are not innovative solutions 

9. Display at least two images in your project that provide the audience with understanding of why your chosen threat to biodiversity is a problem and of an innovative solution to the problem. One image should be of the problem and one image should be of an innovative solution. A graph or chart that illustrates why your chosen threat to biodiversity is a problem or an infographic of a how a solution works are great ideas. You must include a brief 1-2 sentence caption for each image. Caption should be immediately beneath the image. Caption should be a short, simple explanation of the image. While you are welcome to display images that are just of animals, plants, or factories, these images will not count as one of your two images. I.e., A picture of a polar bear, a picture of a factory with smoke rising out of it, or an illustration of the earth on fire do not provide the audience with understanding of why your chosen threat to biodiversity is a problem. 

10. Display your sources: at least three sources must be cited. You do not need to use MLA/APA style. Just supply the full URL on a works cited slide, page, etc. (If you choose to make a video, you still need to visually display your sources. You can display the sources in your video or upload a second file to Canvas with the sources listed.)
